# Evive Engineering Test

## Description

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission. This application was written with Node.js. See instructions below to test the app.

## Instructions

- Clone repo to your machine
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Open app.js and uncomment the test cases one by one to test the main function of the app. Nodemon will listen for changes and automatically restart the server whenever you save, so remember to save every time you comment-out/uncomment a test case. Results are output to the console.
